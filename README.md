Bill Split Calculation: Calculate the total cost per person by dividing the bill.
Adjustable Tip Percentage: Users can set a tip percentage with a slider.
Live Calculation Updates: The total per person updates dynamically as inputs are changed.
Clean, Intuitive UI: Utilizes Jetpack Compose for a modern, efficient user interface.
